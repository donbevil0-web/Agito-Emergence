The next day, Izuku and Aoyama were sparring in Gym Gamma once again, both in their armor. They traded quick, fluid, and calculated maneuvers in a blur of motion. Aoyama had exhibited more solid control during their weeks of training. There were a few hiccups here and there, but nothing too perilous. Aoyama had previously had difficulty sleeping on certain nights, but that had also become less frequent as they progressed.
Honestly, it was uplifting that they had made it so far. However, they were under no illusion that they had truly overcome anything. The risks were still evident, and Aoyama was extra careful to keep his Agito instincts in check. Izuku was less eager to try out Trinity because of how powerful the form was during his trial runs. One session in Ground Beta nearly ended in disaster when he tested out the same punch he used on Muscular. Flame and Storm were adequate for his needs. He had practiced with Todoroki, who wasnâ€™t exactly forthcoming with tips, but he learned a few things. Iida, on the other hand, was far more open and cooperative. They regularly raced each other on normal tracks and obstacle courses specializing in sharp turns and blockades, which really pushed their limits in terms of speed and precision.
All in all, it was looking up to be an optimistic semester following their clash with the League of Villains, Toga Himiko caught and arrested, as well as the other matters that they would rather not dwell on too long. In the end, they were just content that the last several weeks had been rather peaceful, but all of that was about to change once the exams rolled around, the time approaching closer for each passing day.
